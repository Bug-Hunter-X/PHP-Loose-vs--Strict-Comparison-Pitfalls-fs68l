The solution involves consistently using the `===` operator (identical) for comparisons, unless type juggling is explicitly desired. This ensures that comparisons are type-safe and produces predictable results.   The corrected code would be:
```php
$a = 0;
$b = '0';
if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Identical\n";
} else {
  echo "Not identical\n";
}
```
This version accurately reflects the difference in types between `$a` and `$b`, preventing potential unexpected behavior caused by loose comparisons.
