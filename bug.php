In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error is the misuse of the `===` (identical) operator versus the `==` (equal) operator.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when dealing with type juggling. For instance, consider this code:
```php
$a = 0;
$b = '0';
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal\n";
} else {
  echo "Not equal\n";
}
if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Identical\n";
} else {
  echo "Not identical\n";
}
```
The first comparison (`==`) will evaluate to true because PHP loosely compares values, converting the string '0' to an integer 0 before comparison.  However, the second comparison (`===`), which performs strict comparison, will evaluate to false because the types are different (integer versus string).
